# Rack Canonical Host

Rack middleware that lets you define a single host name as the canonical host
for your application. Requests for other host names will then be redirected to
the canonical host.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
gem 'rack-canonical-host'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-canonical-host


## Usage

For most applications, you can insert the middleware into the `config.ru` file
in the root of the application.

Here's a simple example of what the `config.ru` in a Rails application might
look like after adding the `Rack::CanonicalHost` middleware.

``` ruby
require ::File.expand_path('../config/environment',  __FILE__)

use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com'
run YourRailsApp::Application
```

In this case, any requests coming in that aren't for the specified host,
`example.com`, will be redirected, keeping the requested path intact.


### Environment-Specific Configuration

You probably don't want your redirect to happen when developing locally. One
way to prevent this from happening is to use environment variables in your
production environment to set the canonical host name.

With Heroku, you would do this like so:

    $ heroku config:add CANONICAL_HOST=example.com

Then, can configure the middleware like this:

``` ruby
use Rack::CanonicalHost, ENV['CANONICAL_HOST'] if ENV['CANONICAL_HOST']
```

Now, the middleware will only be used if a canonical host has been defined.


### Options

If you'd like the middleware to ignore certain hosts, use the `:ignore`
option:

``` ruby
use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com', ignore: ['api.example.com']
```

In this case, requests for the host `api.example.com` will not be redirected.

Alternatively, you can pass a block whose return value will be used as the
canonical host name.

``` ruby
use Rack::CanonicalHost do |env|
  case env['RACK_ENV'].to_sym
    when :staging then 'staging.example.com'
    when :production then 'example.com'
  end
end
```

If you want it to react only on specific hosts for multi-domain environment use `:if`,
it accepts string, regexp or an array.

``` ruby
use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com', if: /.*\.example\.com/
use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.ru', if: /.*\.example\.ru/
```

To avoid browsers indefinitely caching a 301 redirect, it's a sensible idea to
set an expiry on each redirect, to hedge against the chance you need to change
that redirect in the future.

By default

```ruby
# Browsers will cache host redirects for up to one hour
use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com'

# Browsers will cache host redirects for up to 42 seconds
use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com', cache_expiry: 42

# Browsers will cache host redirects indefinitely (not recommended)
use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com', cache_expiry: false

# Specify a custom value for the Cache-Control header
use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com', cache_expiry: 'no-cache'
```
